<h1 class="math-title"> MATHEMATICS</h1>
<div class="math-top">
    <div class="math-item"> <p> A crucial step in studying mathematics is understanding the relationship between 
    different topics of mathematics. To that end I have compiled a list of worthwhile references that hopefully 
serve as introductions to each topic. This by no means is a complete guide, and most reviews could only be regarded as personaly comments. This page is more geared towards a personal comparison of various introductory texts.
rather than objective judgements due to my lack of knowledge.</p> </div>
    <div class="math-item"> <h2> Analysis</h2> 
        <p class="math-book"> Principles of Mathematical Analysis, Rudin </p> 
        <p> Great introductory text that introduces metric topology 
        early on. Read only the first eight chapters, as there are better references for multivariate analysis. </p>
        <p class="math-book">  Mathematical Analysis, Zorich </p>
        <p> Another great introductory text. I hear that Volume II is especially good in its treatment of differential forms.
        Could be used as a complement to Rudin. I plan to use it for review.</p>
        <p class="math-book"> Analysis on Manifolds, Munkres</p>
        <p> An alternative to Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds, but more detailed. Good as a supplement for multivariate analysis and
        an introduction to manifold theory (which is significantly more involved that the case in Euclidean spaces).</p>
        <p class="math-book"> Complex Analysis, Ahlfors</p>
        <p> The classic complex analysis text.</p>
        <p class="math-book"> Lectures Series in Analysis (Four Volumes), Stein</p>
        <p> Stein's analysis lectures could be perfect references for second-year analysis, though some treatments may lack in rigor.</p>
        <p class="math-book"> Real and Complex Analysis, Rudin</p>
        <p> Another dictionary. Great for brushing up but not starting off.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="math-item"> <h2> Algebra</h2> 
        <p class="math-book"> Abstract Algebra, Dummit and Foote</p>
        <p> The classic introductory text disliked by many. I, for one, think some treatments are overly clumsy and lacking in insights, and algebra is all about insights.</p>
        <p class="math-book"> Algebra, Hungerford</p>
        <p> A very condensed Bourbaki-style textbook. My favorite by far.</p>
        <p class="math-book"> Algebra, Lang</p>
        <p> The classick "brick". A hugely rich reference which I have yet to appreciate.</p>
        <p class="math-book"> Linear Algebra Done Right, Axler</p>
        <p> A functional analysis take on linear algebra, though I would personally prefer a more algebraic treatment. 
        Hoffman and Kunze would be an example of that.</p>
        <p class="math-book"> Advanced Linear Algebra, Roman</p>
        <p> A pretty nice second course in linera algebra by the look of it. Good for those who really want to figure out linear algebra. Otherwise the standard content in a functional analysis or algebra textbook would suffice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="math-item" > <h2> Topology and Geometry </h2>
        <p class="math-book"> Topology, Munkres</p>
        <p> Nice introductory text, the general topology part of which serves as a good companion to studying analysis.</p>
        <p class="math-book"> Introduction to Smooth Manifolds, Lee</p>
        <p> A comprehensive guide to differential geometry. I would probably start it after I finish Munkres or Spivak. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="math-item"> <h2> Other (More Advanced) </h2> 
        <p class="math-book"> A Course in Arithmetic, Serre</p>
        <p> A brilliant book in algebraic number theory.</p>
        <p> (To be continued...)</p>
