<p style="font:bolder 1.5em Helvetica, sans-serif;"> Hello and welcome! </p>
<p> My name is Boxian Wang (pronounced Bo-shian, in case you are unaware), and I'm currently in my first year at Dartmouth College. </p>
<p> My primary interests are mathematics, computer science and physics. Currently, 
I'm planning to major in mathematics and computer science.</p>
<p> I especially enjoy the process of both learning and teaching. 
I have been a part of Dartmouth's peer tutoring program, and have tutored multiple students in courses like MATH8 and
CS10. Right now, I'm serving as TA for CS50.</p>
<p> I'm excited to work at DALI because it is a fantastic place to learn and grow. I'm excited to learn various aspects
of web development (in which I'm but a novice)
, and more importantly, work with talented and smart developers to address real-world needs. There's nothing better than developing 
cool apps!
</p>
<p> I grew up in Nanjing, China. Naturally, I'm well versed in animes and video games. 
I'm also a fan of classical music and Monty Python sketches. In my spare time, I like to play piano and watch classic movies.</p>
